# User Stories

This directory contains the user stories derived from the Airbnb Clone use case diagram. Each user story is written to reflect real-world interactions and expectations of end users, such as guests, hosts, and admins. These stories guide the backend feature implementation for registration, property listing, booking, and payment management.
